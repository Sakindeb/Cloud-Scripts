# Cloud-Scripts
This repo will contain different project scripts that are part of GCP cloud infrastructure development for personal projects
## Startup Script
This is an automation script that adds convenience when starting up already existing instances. The script then sets a remainder for how long before the instance started is terminated.
For the termination command, the script sleeps for set duration before executing the command to turn it off.
 ## Prerequisets
 Before using any of the scripts, the google SDK should be installed and authorization configured for accounts.

 #### The project is constantly changing and the readme is expected to be updated frequently.
